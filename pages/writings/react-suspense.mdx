Most tutorials introduce React as a UI library. This makes sense because React _is_ a UI library. That‚Äôs literally what the tagline says!

I‚Äôve written about the challenges of creating [user interfaces](/the-elements-of-ui-engineering/) before. But this post talks about React in a different way ‚Äî more as a [programming runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system).

**This post won‚Äôt teach you anything about creating user interfaces.** But it might help you understand the React programming model in more depth.

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

## Host Tree

Some programs output numbers. Other programs output poems. Different languages and their runtimes are often optimized for a particular set of use cases, and React is no exception to that.

React programs usually output **a tree that may change over time**. It might be a [DOM tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom), an [iOS hierarchy](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/View%20Hierarchy.html), a tree of [PDF primitives](https://react-pdf.org/), or even of [JSON objects](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html). However, usually, we want to represent some UI with it. We‚Äôll call it a ‚Äú_host_ tree‚Äù because it is a part of the _host environment_ outside of React ‚Äî like DOM or iOS. The host tree usually has [its](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) [own](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622616-addsubview) imperative API. React is a layer on top of it.

So what is React useful for? Very abstractly, it helps you write a program that predictably manipulates a complex host tree in response to external events like interactions, network responses, timers, and so on.

A specialized tool works better than a generic one when it can impose and benefit from particular constraints. React makes a bet on two principles:

-   **Stability.** The host tree is relatively stable and most updates don‚Äôt radically change its overall structure. If an app rearranged all its interactive elements into a completely different combination every second, it would be difficult to use. Where did that button go? Why is my screen dancing?

-   **Regularity.** The host tree can be broken down into UI patterns that look and behave consistently (such as buttons, lists, avatars) rather than random shapes.

**These principles happen to be true for most UIs.** However, React is ill-suited when there are no stable ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù in the output. For example, React may help you write a Twitter client but won‚Äôt be very useful for a [3D pipes screensaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzx9ArZ7MUU).

```jsx App.js
class Button extends React.Component {
	state = {
		color: this.props.color
	};
	render() {
		const { color } = this.state; // üî¥ `color` is stale!
		return (
			<button className={"Button-" + color}>{this.props.children}</button>
		);
	}
}
```
